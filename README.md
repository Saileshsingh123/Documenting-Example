## Project Overview

This data analysis project aims to provide insights into the sales performance of an e-conmerce company over the past year. By analyzing various aspects of the sales data, we seek to identify trends, make data driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the company's performance.

### Data Sources
Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "sales _data.csv" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company.

### Tools 
- Excel - Data Cleaning
  - [Downaload here](https://microsoft.com)
- SQL Server - Data Analysis 
- Power BI - Creating Reports

### Data Cleaning/Preparation
In the intial date preparation phase, we perfonned the following tasks:
1. Data loading and imspection.
2. Handling missing values.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

###  Exploratory Data Analysis 
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key question, such as;
- What is the overall sales trend?
- Which products are top sellers?
- What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis 

Include some interesting code/features worked with 

```sql
SELECT * FROM TABLE1
WHERE COND = 2;
```

#Results/Findings

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The company's sales have been steadily increasing over the past year, with a noticeable. peak during the holiday season.
2. Product Category A is the best-performing category in terms of sales and revenue.
3. Customer segments with high lifetime value (LTV) should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recomendations

Based on the analysis, we recommend the following actions:
- Invest in marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting productsNO Category A.
- Implement a customer segmentation strately to target high-LTV customers effectively.

### Limitations

I had to remove all zero values from budget and nevenue columns because they would have affected the accuracy of my conclusions from the analysis. There are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we can still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
